# Movie Tracker

## For all the Movie Fanatics out there!


This Movie Tracker App can help you keep track of all the movies you have watched and the movies you want to watch, all
in one place. You can also keep track of:
- the Genre of the movie
- Release year of the movie
 
This app would be of great use to film enthusiasts, who watch a large amount of Films; but it can also be used by anyone
who watches movies. This app is of interest to me because I watch a lot of Movies in my free time, and I would love to 
keep track of all the movies I've watched, and want to watch; in one place, as it would be hard to keep it all in mind.
