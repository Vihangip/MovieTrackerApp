# Movie Tracker

## For all the Film Enthusiasts out there.


This Movie Tracker App can help you keep track of all the movies you have watched, all the movies you want to watch and 
what your favourite movies are. You can sort through movies by 
- Genre
- Production year
- Cast Members
 
This app would be of great use to film enthusiasts, who watch a large amount of Films; but it can also be used by anyone
who watches movies. This app is of interest to me because I watch a lot of Movies in my free time, and I would love to 
keep track of all the movies I've watched and want to watch in one place, as it would be hard to keep it all in mind.
